# BASIC FULLSTACK

This repo is my current project and the culmination of my other learning projects (see github repositories).

The scope of this project is to:

phase 1 - assemble a working MVP front end with react and vite 
phase 2 - create a backend with node and express
phase 3 - connect the front end (fe) and back end (be) with api calls (testing with postman)
phase 4 - add a database and connect it to be (using node-postgres)
phase 5 - implement strict typing in FE and BE with typescript
phase 6 - build a couple of react components and make a proper user interface
phase 7 - containerize the app and db with docker
phase 7 - the sky is the limit... 

### concept

All apps should have a purpose. The starting concept for this one is a simple one: robot builder.
The UI should allow users to combine several robot parts to create custom robots. These can be
saved and fetched in the db

The intention is a single page application that utilizes a rest api to connect fe and be.
